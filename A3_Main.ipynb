When we additionally assign probabilities to the rules of the CFG we get a PCFG: a _Probabilistic_ CFG.\n","\n","Given a sufficiently expressive PCFG (one that holds enough rules) we can parse new sentences using the Cocke–Kasami–Younger (CKY) algorithm. You can use this algorithm in three ways: to find the set of all the possible parses $p$ of a sentence $s$ under a PCFG $G$; to find the probability of the sentence by summing up the probabilities of these parses; or to find the parse $p^{*}$ of the highest probability.\n","\n","\n","### Tasks\n","1. In this notebook you will learn how to represent a PCFG in an object-oriented manner as a collection of python classes. These classes are already defined for you. Read them through thoroughly and make sure that you understand them well. You have to use them in task 2.\n","\n","2.
